      "review" :"Beautiful mountain view off the beaten path.The trip may take up to ten hours as sometimes the road is barely there--that's an unexpected \"thrill\"--and it's rough going, but the scenery is worth it, both the destination and the trip there.Reckong Peo is also the commercial and administrative centre of the Kinnaur district as biggest market of entire district is located here and all important governmental as well as administrative offices are located at Reckong Peo. Tourists can take buses to visit all the important villages and other places of district from HRTC Bus Stand at Reckong Peo.",
